Recently I was reading an article by Robin Sharma, where he talks about 5 rituals - and one of them was the &ldquo;*ritual of being a student*&rdquo; everyday for 60 minutes.
He called this &ldquo;60 minute student&rdquo;. To be good at something its important to be an avid learner and to make time for it no matter what.
Not that its just 60 mins and you should stop there, but you get the idea, atleast 60 minutes.

> Schedule 60 minutes a day for your learning. It could be anything- journal, audiobook, paperback, summary.
> No matter the age or place. Every master thinks like a beginner.

And thinking about it, I realized has to do with coming out of your comfort zone and learning, doing something you are a total beginner in.
It&rsquo;s a practice that can reap very high rewards in any profession, and in fast industries like SWE (where theres a new JS framework everyday, huh) your only skill is your skill to learn things.

This blog aims to be just that: a note about what I learnt this week/day/month just like keeping a journal about my progress as an engineer, can go a long way.
Not for anyone to read, not for anyone to share (you are always welcome to, but this isn&rsquo;t written primararily for that purpose).
It&rsquo;s just an engineer&rsquo;s notebook and an engineer trying to stick to a ritual of learning.

That&rsquo;s the idea I grew up with, on who an engineer is. Watching movies like 3 idiots where an engineer is someone who constantly keeps breaking apart objects to for the raw curiosity of how things work. Digging down into the last details till they reach simple first principles.
This is just a way to remain what I have loved - an engineer feeding his curiosity.


### Some rules I promised to myself I will follow:

1.  Not use any kind of LLM to write any part of this blog. I wish to keep it as real and human as possible, and I hate reading what it generates(maybe its just me and my prompts suck).
    But that just defeats the idea.
2.  (more to follow)
