Recently, I watched the Bollywood movie 3 Idiots, and there was a line that really resonated with me:

> सक्सेस के पीछे मत भागो, एक्सीलेंस का पीछा करो। सक्सेस झक मार के तुम्हारे पीछे आएगी।

Translates to something like this "do not run behind success, instead chase excellence and success will come with it!" I believe this dialouge was a translation of what Einstien said [here.](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/albert_einstein_122232)
I believe competent and excellent engineers are built of systemic habits and love towards what they do. Its really hard to be excellent at something you aren't intrested into or something you don't believe in. I mean ofcourse there are really great born engineers but I ain't one.

To become a better engineer, I realized I need to build systems that push me to grow. I’m a big fan of Atomic Habits and the idea that “_You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems._” I also love the concept of a growth mindset—constantly stretching yourself to get better. It’s also particularly worthwhile to reach that elusive [flow state](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>), where you’re so absorbed in the task that everything else fades away.

This blog is my way of systemizing my learning. It’s like a notebook where I can record what I’ve learned, track my progress, and reflect on my growth as an engineer. It’s not written for anyone in particular—just a personal habit I’m forming to stay accountable to myself. If others find value in it, great, but that’s not the main goal.
